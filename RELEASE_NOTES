Interface Changes : 
  o SPEChargeDistribution : public members of data aggregates don't get the
    trailing underscore.  Those denote private members of classes.
  o SPEChargeDistribution gets python bindings
  o I3DOMCalibration the following methods are exposed to python :
    - Get/SetMeanFADCCharge
    - Get/SetMeanATWDCharge
    - Get/SetCombinedSPEChargeDistribution
    - IsMeanATWD/FADCChargeValid
New Features :

Bug Fixes :
  o SPEChargeDistribution::IsValid - This has the correct logic now.
    (isnan(x) || isnan(y)) == (false || false) == false when x and y 
    are non-NaN.  IsValid should return true in this case.  The method 
    has been changed to the equivalent of (!isnan(x) && !isnan(y)).
    Tests have been added as well.

  o IsMeanATWD/FADCChargeValid - Logic was reversed.  It's correct now
    (with tests) and returns true if std::isfinite(charge) and charge > 0.

 V15-03-00 
  o AMANDA classes are no longer visible.
  o Give wavedeform the ability to apply per digitizer s.p.e. corrections. 
    Add necessary calibration constants to I3DOMCalibration. 
    Remove unused old constants from I3DOMCalibration.
  o I3MCHit.weight is no longer accessible from python
  o New MJD for the leap second test.  Go Navy!
  o I3Particle::Clone returns a copy of the particle, but with a new ID.
  o new I3MCTree, I3MCTreePhysicsLibrary, and revamped I3MCTreeUtils

 V14-11-00 - Minor release
  o I3Particles now have mass.  Welcome to the Standard Model.
  o Added support for I3_TESTDATA
  o I3MCTree::GetParent is exposed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
 V14-10-00 - Bugfix release
  o I3PODHolder added.  This cleans up the frame-level POD classes and, with the 
    new operator suite, fixes object comparison, e.g. I3Double comparisons to double
    work as expected.
