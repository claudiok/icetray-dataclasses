This is the README for the testing framework.

See I3HitTest.cxx for a full description of what the test modules
themselves should look like.  I3HitTest is designed to be used as a
template for other test modules, copy-and-modify-to-suit style.

The test routines will be built into the shared library.  There is a
driver program here, "runtests", that allows you to run all, groups
of, or individual tests.  Your tests will automagically be accessable
through this program.

The program will be located in 
$BFD_WORK_DIR/PLATFORM/build/dataclasses/runtests.exe

Run it with no arguments and it will display relevant help.

Get back to me with questions:
