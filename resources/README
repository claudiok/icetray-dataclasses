README

This is a preliminary implemntation of a possible transient data 
structure for IceCube.  It has not been extensively tested and there 
may be bugs!  We don't think so, but by law we are required to give 
this warning. 

BUILDING THE LIBRARY:
This is a bfd project called 'dataclasses' and requires bfd to build it.  
If you're new to bfd, surf on over to 
http://glacier.lbl.gov/icetray for a quick introduction. 

You will need the 'icetray' project to compile dataclasses, which you can get
from CVS on glacier.  

Just follow the standard build proceedure with this project in your workspace.

BUILDING THE DOCUMENTATION
There is a Doxyfile in dataclasses/resources/.  To get the documentation, type
%doxygen dataclasses/resources/Doxyfile 
from your workspace directory.  You'll get a directory doxygen/ with all the 
automatically generated documentation in it.  Since we're still developing, there
are not many comments, so the doxygen stuff is a bit sparse.  But you can still 
use it to get a feel for the structure of the classes.

COMMENTS
We welcome comments to:
dataclass@ssec.wisc.edu

Thanks for looking
