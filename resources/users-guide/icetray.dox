@section howtodoit How to:

If you haven't already downloaded and built IceTray, swing on over to 
http://glacier.lbl.gov/icetray to get the instructions to check out and
build the required <code>icetray</code> and <code>root-icetray</code> projects. 
There is also a tutorial and example application described there.  
In order to continue with the various dataclass tutorials, though, you will 
only need to build <code>icetray</code> and <code>root-icetray</code>.
